<h1><a name="Welcome">Welcome to Microsoft Management Console Version&nbsp;1.0</a></h1>

<p>Welcome to the Internet Information Server 4.0 release of Microsoft Management Console (MMC).  MMC integrates in a single console all the tools required to perform specific administrative tasks.  To create a new console, a system administrator adds administrative tools as snap-ins in MMC. These snap-ins can be the standard administrative tools for Windows, which are all being converted to snap-ins. They can also be administrative tools that have been configured as snap-ins by Independent Software Vendors.  By adding snap-ins to a console, an administrator can assemble all the tools and information required to assess and configure a system component.  Even links to Web-based tools or to Web pages that provide information or updates to system components can be added to a console. </p>

<p>When a console is complete, the administrator can save it in an .msc (Management Saved Console) file. By default, this makes it available in the <strong>My Administrative Tools</strong> group, found in <strong>Programs</strong> on the <strong>Start</strong> menu. The administrator can then deliver the console to others who have been delegated to perform administrative tasks. The console can be delivered by e-mail, placed in a shared folder on the network, or assigned with system policy settings. When the console is opened, it appears in exactly the same configuration in which it was saved.</p>
