<h2><a name="installation">Installation</a></h2>

<p>If you are having trouble installing PWS, or operating the program following installation, check the following items.</p>

<h3><a name="H3_37762316"></a>Uninstalling Previous Versions</h3>

<p>PWS 4.0 does not upgrade PWS 4.0 Alpha, Beta 1, or Beta&nbsp;2 automatically. If you have PWS 4.0 Alpha, Beta 1, or Beta&nbsp;2, you must uninstall it before installing PWS 4.0. You can do this by using the <strong>Add/Remove Programs</strong> application in Control Panel or using the PWS setup program:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, point to <strong>Programs</strong>, point to <strong>Microsoft Internet Information Server</strong>, and click <strong>Internet Information Server Setup</strong>. </li>
<li>Select <strong>Remove All</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="testing">Testing Your Installation</a></h2>

<p>After installing, you can test your installation by using Internet Explorer to view the files in your home directory.</p>

<p class="bigfix">&nbsp;</p>
<big>To test a Web site on your intranet</big><!--</p>--><br>

<ol>
<li>Ensure that your computer has an active network connection and that the WINS server service (or other name resolution method) is functioning.</li>
<li>Start a Web browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer.</li>
<li>Type in the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the home directory of your new server.</li>
<p>The URL is &#147;http://&#148; followed by the Windows Networking name of your server, followed by the path of the file you want to view. (Note the forward slash marks.) For example, if your Web site is registered with the WINS server as &#147;Admin1&#148; and you want to view the file Homepage.htm in the root of the home directory, in the <strong>Address</strong> box you type <strong>http://admin1/homepage.htm</strong>, and then press Enter. The home page appears on the screen.<!--</p>--><br>
</ol>

<p class="bigfix">&nbsp;</p>
<big>To test a Web site on a computer not connected to a network</big><!--</p>--><br>
<ol>
<li>Start a Web browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer.</li>
<li>Type in the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the home directory of your new server.</li>
<p>The URL is &#147;http://&#148; followed by the name of your computer, followed by the path of the file you want to view. (Note the forward slash marks.) To find the name of your computer, point to <strong>Start</strong>, point to <strong>Settings</strong>, and click <strong>Control Panel</strong>. Open the Network application to view the computer name.</li>
<li>If your browser displays an error message saying the site or server cannot be found, you may need to install the Microsoft Loopback Adapter and edit your HOSTS file. 
<ol>
<li>In the Network application, select the <strong>Adapters</strong> tab. 
<li>On the <strong>Adapters</strong> property sheet, click <strong>Add</strong>. 
<li>Select <strong>MS Loopback Adapter</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>. You are prompted for your Windows&nbsp;NT installation disks.</li> 
</ol>
</ol>


<h2><a name="userrights">User Rights</a></h2>

<p>If a user is having trouble viewing your published files (that is, the user is receiving HTTP "403; Forbidden" or similar HTTP errors when attempting to request a Web page), then there is probably a  problem related to the user rights that are configured on your Web site. In order to give users access to your published files, check the following items.</p>

<ol>
<li>Find the specific file, directory, or virtual directory that the user cannot access in Internet Service Manager. </li>
<li>View the properties for that file, directory, or virtual directory. </li>
<li>Select the <strong>File</strong> property sheet (if viewing properties of a file) or <strong>Directory</strong> property sheet (if viewing the properties of a directory or virtual directory). Ensure that the directory or file has Read access permissions (the <strong>Read</strong> check box is selected). </li>
<li>Select the <strong>File Security</strong> or <strong>Directory Security</strong> property sheet. </li>
<li>Ensure that the user has either anonymous access, basic authentication permissions, or Windows&nbsp;NT Challenge/Response permissions that will allow him or her to view the content by clicking the <strong>Edit</strong> button in the <strong>Anonymous Access and Authentication Control</strong> field. </li>
 <li>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button in the <strong>TCP/IP and Domain Name Restrictions</strong> field to ensure that the client's computer, group of computers, or domain name has not been restricted from accessing your resource.</li>
</ol> 

<h2><a name="anonymous">Anonymous Authentication</a></h2>

<p>If an anonymous user cannot access your site, check the following.</p>

<p>Ensure that the anonymous user's password is the same in both Internet Service Manager and User Manager:</p>

<ol>
<li>In ISM, select the Web site, virtual directory, directory, or file on which you need to check anonymous access and view its properties. </li>
<li>Select the <strong>File Security</strong> property sheet (if viewing properties of a file) or <strong>Directory Security</strong> property sheet (if viewing properties of a Web site, virtual directory, or directory) and click the <strong>Edit</strong> button in the <strong>Anonymous Access and Authentication Control</strong> field. </li>
<li>In the <strong>Authentication Methods</strong> dialog box, make sure that the <strong>Allow Anonymous Access</strong> check box is selected. </li>
<li>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button to view the user name and password that are used when an anonymous user connects to your site. In order to enable your Web site to automatically synchronize your anonymous password settings with those set in Windows&nbsp;NT, select the <strong>Enable Automatic Password Sychronization</strong> check box (it is selected by default for all resources that allow anonymous access). </li>
</ol>

<p>Ensure that the anonymous user has <strong>Log on locally</strong> rights in Windows&nbsp;NT User Manager for Domains:</p>

<ol>
<li>Launch User Manager from the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) toolbar.</li>
<li>In User Manager, select <strong>User Rights</strong> in the <strong>Policies</strong> menu. </li>
<li>Choose the right <strong>Log On Locally</strong> and make sure IUSR_<machine name> (or your anonymous account) shows up in the list.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you are having trouble <em>preventing</em> an anonymous user from accessing your site, please check the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>File Security</strong> property sheet (if viewing properties of a file) or <strong>Directory Security</strong> property sheet (if viewing properties of a Web site, virtual directory, or directory) and click the <strong>Edit</strong> button in the <strong>Anonymous Access and Authentication Control</strong> field. </li>
<li>In the <strong>Authentication Methods</strong> dialog box, make sure that the <strong>Allow Anonymous Access</strong> check box is <em>not</em> selected.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="basic">Basic Authentication</a></h2>

<p>If users with Basic Authentication rights are having trouble accessing your site, please check the following.</p>

<p>Ensure that the login user has <strong>Log on locally</strong> rights in Windows&nbsp;NT User Manager for Domains:</p>

<ol>
<li>Launch User Manager from the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) toolbar.</li>
<li>In User Manager, select <strong>User Rights</strong> in the <strong>Policies</strong> menu. </li>
<li>Choose the right <strong>Log On Locally</strong> and make sure IUSR_<machine name> (or your anonymous account) shows up in the list.</li>
</ol>

<p>Make sure that you specify a Default Logon Domain for the user: in the <strong>Authentication Methods</strong> dialog box, click <strong>Edit</strong> in the <strong>Basic Authentication</strong> field and enter the domain name.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about the safety of transmitting passwords in clear text (an industry standard that applies to Basic Authentication), use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to secure clear text passwords. You can configure SSL Client authentication by launching the <strong>Secure Communications</strong> dialog box from the <strong>Directory Security</strong> (or <strong>File Security</strong>) property sheet. Use Key Manager to create Key requests and the <strong>Secure Communications</strong> dialog box to enable an SSL Authentication scheme.</p>
