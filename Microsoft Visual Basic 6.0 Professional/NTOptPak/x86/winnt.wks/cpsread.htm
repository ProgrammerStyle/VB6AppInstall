<p><a name=E10E31><strong>Known Issues with Connection Point Services</strong></a></p>

<ul>
<li>When you first start the Phone Book Administrator, you will not be able to post to the Phone Book Service because of security reasons.To enable posting: 
<ol>
<li>Make sure the Default FTP service is installed and running on the computer running the Phone Book Service. If Default FTP service is not installed, see your <i>Internet Information Server Installation and Planning Guide</i> for installation procedures.</li>
<li>Make sure the virtual root directory for posting has been set up. To do this, in the left pane of the Microsoft Management Console, double-click Default FTP site. A virtual directory called PBSData should appear in the tree. <br><br>If you have installed the FTP service after installing Phone Book Service, you will have to set up the PBSData virtual directory. <br><br>To set up the virtual directory, right-click Default FTP site, point to New, and then click Virtual Directory. Then follow the directions in the New Virtual Directory wizard: 
<ol>
<li>When it prompts you for the alias of the virtual directory,type PBSdata.</li>
<li>When it prompts you for the physical path of the directory, type: <br><strong>c:\inetpub\wwwroot\Phone Book Service\data</strong> </li>
<li>When it prompts you to provide access permissions, make sure <strong>Allow Write Access</strong> is checked, and then click Finish.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If you have not already done so in the previous step, enable write access to the posting virtual directory. To do this, right-click PBSData, and then click Properties. On the Virtual Directory tab, make sure the Write box is checked. </li>
<li>If you want the Phone Book Service directory to be shared securely, you can specify a Windows NT user account that will be used by Phone Book Administrator. For more information, see the "Security Settings" section in the <i>Connection Point Services Administration Reference</i>. </li>
</ol>
For more information, see the Connection Point Services Administration Guide.</li>
<li>If you uninstall Phone Book Service, the virtual directories are not automatically removed from the Microsoft Management Console. You will have to remove them by hand.</li>
<li>If you are running Connection Point Services remotely and the file server connection
is lost, a run-time error may occur or the Phone Book Administrator will hang.</li>
<li>Phone Book Administrator does not support remotely posting or importing phone books from one type of platform to a different type (for example, from an x86 computer to an Alpha computer).</li>
<li>Phone book files must be in plain text format (.txt).  Phone book files saved in other formats (for example, Word, Wordpad, or Rich-Text Format) will not work properly.</li>
<li>Phone book files will not post correctly when usernames or hostnames are typed in a double-byte character set (DBCS). Please post using the IP address of the phone book server and an SBCS user account.</li>
<li>If you uninstall Microsoft&reg; Access 97 or Visual Basic&reg; from a computer running Phone Book Administrator, you must reinstall Phone Book Adminstrator after the uninstallation is finished. </li>
<li>Phone Book Administrator can only import region files containing 200 region entries or fewer by using the graphical interface. If your region file contains more than 200 region entries, either split the file into two separate files, or import the region file by using the command-line interface. </li>
</ul>
